# The Commons

Included in this repo is a wp-content directory and a theme built off the grid-test.html template. I've also added a gitignore should you choose to add this git repo to a WPE deployment process. All you have to do to try out the theme is upload it to the wp-content/themes directory for whatever host you decide to work within.

## Notes

- A good tut on converting html pages into a WP Theme https://wpengine.com/resources/convert-html-to-wordpress-theme/
- An example query for posts is done on front-page.php. You can adapt this for many use-cases. You can see a simple version of the loop in index.php.
- The WordPress Codex has basically all information you would need. Google helps too. https://codex.wordpress.org/
- Loading content dyanamically is generally done through ajax. Example tut here https://wpmudev.com/blog/load-posts-ajax/
